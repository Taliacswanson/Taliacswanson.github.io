    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Talia C. Swanson, and I am currently a second-year Master of Public Health
      (MPH) student in the Epidemiology concentration. I completed my Bachelor of Science
      in Biology at the University of Georgia this past summer and am originally from
      Atlanta, Georgia.

  <!-- RESEARCH INTERESTS -->
  <section id="research">
    <h2>RESEARCH INTERESTS & GOALS</h2>

    <p>
      My research interests focus on environmental exposures, particularly particulate
      matter (PM2.5), and how these exposures contribute to the development of chronic
      disease. I am also interested in social determinants of health, with an emphasis
      on how cultural choices and structural factors influence health outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to my epidemiologic interests, in the ACCESS Lab under the Cellular
      Biology Department, I examine the undergraduate experience in STEM spaces, with a
      focus on how institutional structures and learning environments shape student
      engagement, retention, and success.
    </p>
      Long term I hope to work on environemntal exposures and how they contribute to respiratory and neurodegenerative disease
      while working in the federal sector.
  </section>

   <!-- DATA ANALYSIS EXPERIENCE -->
  <section id="DATA ANALYSIS EXPERIENCE">
    <h2>DATA ANALYSIS EXPERIENCE</h2>

    <p>
      I have taken EPID 7010 and BIOS 7010/7020 that focused on using SAS to produce survival models, regression models, and ANOVA tests. 
      I have also worked on an independent project assessing major depressive episodes in adolescents aged 12-17, examining the factors
      of culture and racial demographics for multivariate regression modeling using R. I hope to build on my skills in this class to become
      more confident in analyzing data as I hope to incorporate coding into my future career. 
      
 
      <!-- HOBBIES -->
  <section id="hobbies">
    <h2>HOBBIES</h2>

    <p>
      Outside of academics, I enjoy playing musical instruments, including the flute,
      piccolo, and violin. I also enjoy reading in my spare time, particularly fantasy
      and myth-based genres involving vampires, elves, warlocks, and related themes.
